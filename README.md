# WMRateMyProfessorChromeExtension

This is a chrome extension that modifies the result pages from [William and Mary's Open Course List](https://courselist.wm.edu/) 
to include the ratings associated with each professor from RateMyProfessor.com. For the professors it finds an query hit for,
the Overall, Helpfulness, Clarity, and Easiness ratings are injected into the course list table, as well as a link to the
professor's complete page so that reviews can be seen as well.
